### Welcome to the PyCam course webpage
This page provides links to the course materials and example solutions to the exercises for the "Introduction to solving biological problems with Python" course run by the [Graduate School of Life Sciences](http://www.training.cam.ac.uk/gsls/), University of Cambridge.

- [Etherpad for Dec16 course](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/pycam-dec16)

### Course materials
The course materials are available as [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) files,
one for each session of the course. Jupyter notebooks allow you to interactively run python code in your browser
and if you [install Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) on your own machine
you can then run the notebooks and experiment with the example code. A quick installation guide is also available
in our course GitHub repository in the [README.md file](https://github.com/pycam/python-intro/blob/master/README.md).
The notebook and example data files as well as scripts used in the course are available to download from
our [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/pycam/python-intro).

Static renderings of the notebooks (that do not support interactively running the examples)
are also available (using the [Jupyter notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)) as a service from GitHub:

### Course objectives
- Day 1:
  - **Recall** how to print, create variables and save Python code in files
  - **List** the most common data types in Python
  - **Explain** how to write conditions and loops in Python
  - **Use and compare** these concepts in different code examples
  - **propose and create** solutions using these concepts in different exercises
- Day 2:
  - **Recall** what we've learned so far on variables, common data types, conditions and loops
  - **Propose and create** solutions using these concepts in an exercise
  - **Employ** functions and modules to reuse code
  - **Practice** reading and writing files with Python
  - **Use** third-party library BioPython
  - **Solve** more complex exercises

### Exercise solutions
Example solutions to all of the exercises from the course materials are available from the
course repository in the [solutions folder](https://github.com/pycam/python-intro/tree/master/solutions).
The solution scripts are named sequentially for each session,
for example [ex1_2_3.py](https://github.com/pycam/python-intro/blob/master/solutions/ex1_2_3.py) contains a solution for the 3rd set of exercises from day 1, session 2.

Note that these solutions are just examples, and there are many 'correct' solutions to these exercises. If you spot any issues or bugs with the solutions, or indeed any of the course materials, please let us know (pull requests are welcome!)
