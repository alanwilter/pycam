{"name":"Introduction to solving biological problems with Python","tagline":"Cambridge Area Python","body":"### Welcome to the course webpage\r\nThis page provides links to the course materials and example solutions to the exercises for the \"Introduction to solving biological problems with Python\" course run by the [Graduate School of Life Sciences](http://www.training.cam.ac.uk/gsls/), University of Cambridge. Some background on the course presenters is also available.\r\n\r\n### Course materials\r\nThe course materials are available as [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) files, one for each session of the course. IPython notebooks allow you to interactively run the example code and if you [install IPython](http://ipython.org/install.html) on your own machine you can then run the notebooks locally and experiment with the code. The notebook files and any example data files used in the course are available to download from the [course github repository](http://github.com/grsr/python-course).\r\n\r\nStatic renderings of the notebooks (that do not support interactively running the examples) are also available (using the [IPython notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/)):\r\n\r\n- [Session 1](http://bit.ly/gslspython1)\r\n- [Session 2](http://bit.ly/gslspython2)\r\n- [Session 3](http://bit.ly/gslspython3)\r\n- [Session 4](http://bit.ly/gslspython4)\r\n\r\n### Exercise solutions\r\nExample solutions to all of the exercises from the course materials are available from the course repository in the [solutions folder](https://github.com/grsr/python-course/tree/master/solutions).\r\n\r\nNote that these solutions are just examples, and there are many 'correct' solutions to these exercises. If you spot any issues or bugs with the solutions, or indeed the course materials, please let us know (pull requests are welcome!)\r\n\r\n### Presenters\r\n- Tim Stevens, Babraham Institute\r\n- [Graham Ritchie](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/graham-ritchie), EBI & Sanger Institute\r\n- Gabor Bunkoczi, CIMR, University of Cambridge\r\n- James Morris, Sanger Institute","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
